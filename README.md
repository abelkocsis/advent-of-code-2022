# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) is an Advent calendar of coding puzzles for each day in December by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). This repo contains my Java solutions for AoC 2022, where I managed to get all 50 starts.

## Runnig the code

From Day02, you can compile the code by running `javac Day<dayNumber>.java`, and then running the code by running `java Day<dayNumber>`. 

You might need the flag `-Xmx6g` to increase the heap size, or `-Xss4m` to increase the stack size during runtime.
